#Boys Latin has hired you to develop a grade checker program for students. 
#Your program should be able to do the following; allow a student to enter a numerical grade, 
#then return the appropriate letter grade. For example; 
#if a student enters the number 80, the program should give back the letter grade "B".
#Your program should then repeat by  asking the user to enter another numerical grade. Each time a user
#enters another numerical grade, it should perform some calculation to average out the grades and show the new letter grade,
# For example: if the user enters the number 70, and the 100, they're average should be an 85, which i 

"the promt wants me to creat looping program that well take in a number," 
"and the program well retrun the aveage letter grade."

#how do we calutate the avarge
grade= [50,100,50,70,70,80,90,70]
grades=508# needed to add
scoreOfGrade=len(grade)#needed to count
grades/scoreOfGrade#divid


"promt said repeat=loop" 
"enter numarical grade= float /datatyp"
"numberenter solve= arithmitic ops"
"return a tetter grade =give bake a string " 
" compare the grade to a letter garde if/else </>"
"floaets and or  integers are to be taking"
"should be able to give back a letter grade based on the numbers that was given"
