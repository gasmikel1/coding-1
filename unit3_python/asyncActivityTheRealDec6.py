#Inside of your unit 3 folder create a new file called 
#asyncActivityDec6.py OR asyncActivityDec6.js, depending on which programming language you are learning. 
#Please follow the directions provided and answer the following questions.This will be do at the end of class. This will need to be submitted whether you are present or not. 
#The questions are code agnostic, meaning it does not matter which
#coding language you are learning- you should be able to answer them 
#regardless of if you are learning JavaScript or Python.
#Good luck.
#1. Create a function that will accept a word in the function parameter
#and return the word in reverse order.
#For example, the word 'pet' should return as 'tep', the word 'book'
#should return as 'koob', etc.
#HINT- There is a built-in function that you can use to accomplish this. 
#Please use W3 schools to research what function you'll need to use.
#2. Create a function that uses a conditional statement to output a block
#of text that will tell users about a states landmarks.
#Your program should return the following states and their respective
#landmarks. For example, if a user passes in the value of south carolina,
#in the function parameter, your program should return the message:
#' A landmark in South Carolina is Fort Sumter, where the inital shots of the'
#'American Civil war took place.' WRITE A COMPLETE SENTENCE!
#Pennsylvania = Liberty Bell.
#New York = Statue of Liberty.
#California = Hollywood Walk of Fame.
#One additional state and landmark of your choice.
#If you pass in a state that does not exist in your program,
#your function should return a message saying that the state
#could not be found.
